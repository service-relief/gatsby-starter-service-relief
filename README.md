## 1️⃣ Get Ready

### Secure a domain name

Generally we're using the pattern `citynameservicerelief.com` -- for example:

- `austinservicerelief.com`
- `seattleservicerelief.com`

### Create your accounts

First, you'll need to create a few accounts with free tiers from different software services.

#### 👉🏼 Create a GitHub Account

If you have a GitHub account, go ahead and [log in](https://github.com/join). If not, [sign up for an account](https://github.com/join).

#### 👉🏼 Create a Netlify Account

If you have a Netlify account, go ahead and [log in](https://app.netlify.com/signup). If not, [sign up for an account](https://github.com/join). (_Recommend logging in with GitHub._)

#### 👉🏼 Create an Airtable Account

If you have an Airtable account, go ahead and [log in](https://airtable.com/login). If not, [sign up for an account](https://airtable.com/signup).

## 2️⃣ Set up your data source

### Set up Airtable base

To set up Airtable, you can use a base template configured specifically for a service relief site.

👉🏼 [Open the template](https://airtable.com/addBaseFromShare/shroKwQGVsips8KI2?utm_source=airtable_shared_application) and click "Add base".

![Workspace showing bases in Airtable](./assets/images/airtable-base-copy.png)

Then you should see several tiles that correspond to individual "Bases" that Airtable has set up for you. Look for "Service Relief Template".

👉🏼 Hover over the "Service Relief Template" tile, and click the "down" caret that appears. Replace the text **"Service Relief Template"** with something like **"Service Relief Austin"**. (_Use your city name_).

### Collect keys from Airtable

In order for your site to grab the data from your Airtable document, you'll need to collect **4 key values**.

Copy the following snippet into a text file.

```
AIRTABLE_API_KEY=key00000000000000
AIRTABLE_BASE_ID=app00000000000000
AIRTABLE_TABLE_NAME=tbl00000000000
AIRTABLE_EMBED_ID=shr0000000000000
```

#### Collect Airtable API key

> Your **API key** is secret, sort of like a key for a safe deposit box. Don't share it.

👉🏼 Visit your [Airtable account](https://airtable.com/account), and find the "API" section.

👉🏼 Click the "Generate API key" button.

![Button to generate API key](./assets/images/generate.png)

👉🏼 Click on the dots to show your key, and copy it.

![API key to copy](./assets/images/copy-key.png)

👉🏼 Paste the key in your text file as the value for `AIRTABLE_API_KEY`.

For example, if my key were `key123`, it would look like this:

```
AIRTABLE_API_KEY=key123
AIRTABLE_BASE_ID=app00000000000000
AIRTABLE_TABLE_NAME=tbl00000000000
AIRTABLE_EMBED_ID=shr0000000000000
```

#### Collect Airtable Base Id

👉🏼 Visit [the Airtable API page](https://airtable.com/api).

👉🏼 Click on the base you just created and renamed for your city.

![An Airtable base ID in the API section](./assets/images/airtable-base-id.gif)

👉🏼 Copy the base id found halfway down the page (highlighted in the gif above).

👉🏼 Paste the id in your text file as the value for `AIRTABLE_BASE_ID`.

For example, if my key were `app123`, it would look like this:

```
AIRTABLE_API_KEY=key123
AIRTABLE_BASE_ID=app123
AIRTABLE_TABLE_NAME=tbl00000000000
AIRTABLE_EMBED_ID=shr0000000000000
```

#### Collect Airtable Table Id

👉🏼 Visit the Airtable base you've created for your city by visiting the [Airtable homepage](https://airtable.com/) and then clicking the tile for your base.

You can find your table id in part of the url. After `https://airtable.com/`, copy everything before the next `/`. For example, in the following URL:

`https://airtable.com/tbl6QXLCylcd2ukYr/viw0PQQWbtAfxZ8qa`

The part you need would be `tbl6QXLCylcd2ukYr`.

![An Airtable table ID from the url of your base](./assets/images/airtable-table-id.gif)

👉🏼 Paste the table id in your text file as the value for `AIRTABLE_TABLE_NAME`.

For example, if my table id were `tbl123`, it would look like this:

```
AIRTABLE_API_KEY=key123
AIRTABLE_BASE_ID=app123
AIRTABLE_TABLE_NAME=tbl123
AIRTABLE_EMBED_ID=shr0000000000000
```

#### Collect Airtable Embed Id

👉🏼 Click the "Grid View" at the top left of your base.

👉🏼 Select "Submit a Fundraiser". This will take you to the form view, a submission form created automatically, which corresponds to your Airtable base.

👉🏼 Click "Share Form". You should see a link. Copy everything after `https://airtable.com/`.

![Flow to find and copy the embed id](./assets/images/airtable-embed-id.gif)

👉🏼 Paste the embed id in your text file as the value for `AIRTABLE_EMBED_ID`.

For example, if my table id were `shr123`, it would look like this:

```
AIRTABLE_API_KEY=key123
AIRTABLE_BASE_ID=app123
AIRTABLE_TABLE_NAME=tbl123
AIRTABLE_EMBED_ID=shr123
```

With all four values collected, you're ready to set up the site.

### 3️⃣ Deploy Your Site

#### Deploy to Netlify

> _Note: We plan to set up instructions for other providers eventually, as well._

👉🏼 Click the button below to begin the process of deploying to Netlify.

[![Deploy to Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/img/deploy/button.svg)](https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/service-relief/gatsby-starter-service-relief)

👉🏼 Click "Connect to GitHub". (_You should already be logged in, but if you're not, log in_).

![Netlify deploy flow](./assets/images/netlify-connect-github.png)

👉🏼 For the repository name, use something like `service-relief-austin` (_using your city, of course_).

👉🏼 Use the text file with your four Airtable values to populate the prompts for API key, base id, table name, and embed id.

👉🏼 In the final two prompts, specify your city and state. (_We'll use this to personalize your site a bit_).

![Netlify create site](./assets/images/netlify-create-site.png)

👉🏼 Click "Save and Deploy".

It will take a little while for your new site to build. You'll see the message "Site deploy in progress".

When the build is published, you'll see a live green link under the site title:

![Netlify open site](./assets/images/netlify-open-site.png)

#### Customize the site domain

You can set a custom domain in your Netlify site settings. From your site's main admin page on Netlify:

👉🏼 Click "Domain Settings".

![Netlify domain settings](./assets/images/netlify-domain-settings.png)

👉🏼 Under "Custom Domains", click "Add Custom Domain".

![Netlify domain settings](./assets/images/netlify-add-domain.png).

From there, follow the steps to add your domain.
